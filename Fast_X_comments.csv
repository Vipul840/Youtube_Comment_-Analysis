Review
"Guys,remember it started off with a piece of bread and tuna"
"I loved the part when it is revealed that Dom actually possessed ""Reality Stone"".. He said Reality can be whatever I want, then in flashback scenes we saw by using reality stone Dom made Han and Giselle alive again, added shaw in the family and created a brother"
BRAİN OCANNER didn't want it to be like this
Stupid movies for stupid people.
"I just watch the whole thing, this is already the 10th sequel already and they still wanted to add another sequel☠️"
"I loved the part when goku said Kamehameha, and dom answered, ""famifamilyhaa"", gave me the chills"
"comments: i love the part...
me: i love it alllllllllllll"
Aquaman has to act for LGBTQ shit? Or is that just a joke?
Booooommmm 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We want to see the rock in next movie
live action hot wheels 💀💀
"There Was Literally No Reason For Larson To Be In This Movie, Her & The Reveal In The End Was Absolutely Unnecessary, Great Film Outside Of That, Waaaaayyyy Better Then F9, F9 Was A Joke!"
Best movie of 2023 ❤
Garbage don't waste your money
AS a New Channel its great inspiration for Me 
I watched the movie and it is cool!
🔥
"🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/7_SZi_9eSZE

Yana vokkof kaffer naaier ok
Judus priest!! Is this the last film in the series? Overkill
"What I learn from this movie :
- Mustang's durability really worth the price
- Dom's team is immortal if you haven't seen their dead bodies"
Out of all the people they will add jason mamoa? He made this series into joke stream
"At this point I wouldn't be surprised if the nephew of the guy who had his DVD players stolen in the first movie comes back for revenge against Dom. 

""Dominic Torreto, you stole my uncle's DVD players. I'm going to destroy your family and take away everything you love""."
I love that they based this movie off of the bible
The story between 5 big muscle men and 6 superheroes.
"I came here to search for the song used in the trailer at 1:40 but seeing the ""I love the part..."" trend made me scroll the comment section to a point where I couldn't control my laughter. And just to keep up with my YouTube ""Family"", I love the part where Dante says, ""Can't wait to see you get out of this one"" and Dom says, ""My family will get me out of this one too!"""
I literally loved the appearance of Jason Statham and Gal Gadot ( my fav) but missed Dwayne johnson. Miss you Paul...
I love that part where Batman beat toreto with  in the finish line
Only thing that will save this frachise is Tokyo Drift 2
Fast x cringiest fast movie 😂
"為正在各種煩惱或病苦中、障礙特別多，或自覺會短壽的有緣人（請加油！不用灰心），介紹一部專為此類問題而設的佛經——「藥師經、藥師咒」。此經咒字數雖少但福德佛力極大，若能讀誦、書寫、印經或轉發經文，讓更多人接觸到，即能得到消災、治病、延壽、滅罪、增福、衣食豐足、所求如願等無量福德利益，轉業改命，復得健康長壽的快樂人生。即使你自覺無病無苦，它還是可以增加你無量福報，因為多念誦也能在冥冥中使此經咒為更多此世界的人所接觸到，由此增加了他們的健康壽命財富等，從而使你累積極大的善業福德，人生各方面都能更進一步。你亦可為有需要的親友念誦迴向亦能有效。所以勸大家多多讀誦、轉發，累積無量改命功德。（當然平日行為也要盡量改惡向善）（看見此文「點讚隨喜」也能有一份功德）（南無「僧伽吒經」，若得見此經名即能滅罪。）

藥師經全文六千多字，有興趣可自行搜尋（篇幅所限貼不出來），最好念誦全文。但若覺字數太多，也可選擇單誦藥師經的核心部分或藥師咒、心咒或名號等。藥師經咒，求治病延壽最是靈驗，亦可求財、滿願、亦可往生西方和得人天護佑等。*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。並且可在每天早上對一杯清水念藥師咒108遍然後給患者喝下去，這樣會更有效。(雖說能治病，但還是該去看醫生的，但它能讓你冥冥中總會遇到更好的醫藥治療，且你身體的自癒能力也會更強，亦能得藥師佛力之加持，故亦的確有可能不藥而癒。若念誦的量和質都足夠高，則醫生都治不好的重病亦有可能治癒。)

藥師經的核心部分（經心）只有約一千字，更方便持誦，且已包括藥師經最主要的功德利益，全文如下：

「復次、曼殊室利！若有四眾：苾芻、苾芻尼、鄔波索迦、鄔波斯迦，及餘淨信善男子、善女人等，有能受持八分齋戒，或經一年、或復三月受持學處，以此善根，願生西方極樂世界無量壽佛所聽聞正法而未定者，若聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，臨命終時，有八大菩薩，其名曰：文殊師利菩薩，觀世音菩薩，得大勢菩薩，無盡意菩薩，寶檀華菩薩，藥王菩薩，藥上菩薩，彌勒菩薩。是八大菩薩乘空而來，示其道路，即於彼界種種雜色眾寶華中，自然化生」。
 
「或有因此，生於天上，雖生天上，而本善根，亦未窮盡，不復更生諸餘惡趣。天上壽盡，還生人間，或為輪王，統攝四洲，威德自在，安立無量百千有情於十善道；或生剎帝利、婆羅門、居士大家，多饒財寶，倉庫盈溢，形相端嚴，眷屬具足，聰明智慧，勇健威猛，如大力士。若是女人，得聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，至心受持，於後不復更受女身」。
 
「復次、曼殊室利！彼藥師琉璃光如來得菩提時，由本願力，觀諸有情，遇眾病苦瘦攣、乾消、黃熱等病；或被厭魅、蠱毒所中；或復短命，或時橫死；欲令是等病苦消除，所求願滿」。
 
「時彼世尊，入三摩地，名曰除滅一切眾生苦惱。既入定已，於肉髻中出大光明，光中演說，大陀羅尼曰：『那謨薄伽筏帝，裨殺社，窶嚕，薜琉璃，缽剌婆，喝囉闍也，怛陀揭多耶，阿羅訶帝，三藐三勃陀耶。怛姪阤：唵，鞞殺逝，鞞殺逝，鞞殺社，三沒揭帝娑訶』」。爾時、光中說此咒已，大地震動，放大光明，一切眾生病苦皆除，受安隱樂。
 
「曼殊室利！若見男子、女人有病苦者，應當一心，為彼病人，常清淨澡漱，或食、或藥、或無蟲水、咒一百八遍，與彼服食，所有病苦悉皆消滅。若有所求，志心念誦，皆得如是，無病延年；命終之後，生彼世界，得不退轉，乃至菩提。是故曼殊室利！若有男子、女人，於彼藥師琉璃光如來，至心殷重，恭敬供養者，常持此咒，勿令廢忘」。
 
「復次、曼殊室利！若有淨信男子女人，得聞藥師琉璃光如來應正等覺所有名號，聞已誦持。晨嚼齒木，澡漱清淨，以諸香花，燒香、塗香，作眾伎樂，供養形象。於此經典，若自書，若教人書，一心受持，聽聞其義。於彼法師，應修供養：一切所有資身之具，悉皆施與，勿令乏少。如是便蒙諸佛護念，所求願滿，乃至菩提」。
 
爾時、曼殊室利童子白佛言：「世尊！我當誓於像法轉時，以種種方便，令諸淨信善男子、善女人等，得聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，乃至睡中亦以佛名覺悟其耳。世尊！若於此經受持讀誦。或復為他演說開示；若自書、若教人書；恭敬尊重，以種種華香、塗香、末香、燒香、花鬘、瓔珞、幡（番）蓋、伎樂，而為供養；以五色綵，作囊盛之；掃灑淨處，敷設高座，而用安處。爾時、四大天王與其眷屬，及餘無量百千天眾，皆詣其所，供養守護。世尊！若此經寶流行之處，有能受持，以彼世尊藥師琉璃光如來本願功德，及聞名號，當知是處無復橫死；亦復不為諸惡鬼神奪其精氣，設已奪者，還得如故，身心安樂。」

梵音藥師咒之國語註音：（可參考相關YouTube影片學習發音）*若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。
「那摩 巴噶瓦爹 白薩加 咕嚕 外度裡呀 缽啊巴 喇加呀 達踏嘎達呀 啊喇爹 三藐三布達呀， 達滴呀踏，嗡，白沙接 白沙接 白沙駕 三目嘎爹 刷哈」

藥師佛心咒國語註音：
「嗲雅他唵 貝看傑 貝看傑 瑪哈貝看傑 喇札沙母恩嘎得 梭哈」

藥師解冤咒：（此咒可除了具治病延壽之效，還能解冤消業，可以消去與冤家的恩怨，使人際關係變好，夫妻和睦等）
「解結解結解冤結  解了多生冤和業
洗心滌慮發虔誠  今對佛前求解結
藥師佛  藥師佛  消災延壽藥師佛  隨心滿願藥師佛」

若仍覺經咒太長或難學，亦可單誦藥師佛之聖號：南無藥師琉璃光如來或南無藥師佛。當然重申一遍，經咒威力功德當然是據字數之多少而等而下之的，所以最好是誦經典全文，只是為了方便，所以才有更便於持誦的經心或咒語部分，但當然你念字數更少的法若想要有跟讀經一遍相同之功德，就該念誦更多遍了。
*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。

Aqua man be touchy touchy with his kids tho!
"When morbius said “it’s morbin time” but then Dom said “no, it’s family time” I morbed all over the scene! Oscar a truly nomination"
I actually walked out the movie theater for the first time eva 😂😭
This is not how you do a trailer. They ended up spoiling the movie.
আলহামদুলিল্লাহ  নিজেই ক্যামেরার সামনে এসে ভিডিও  দিয়েছি আমার জন্য দোয়া করবেন সবাইকে ধন্যবাদ ❤
damn the real movie left my hanging I might need some time to move on from it
Wowww
Haduh gantung
Great thanks  ❤  ❤
"This trailer is sending me is saying is that, people aren’t gonna see it so they spoil you with longer trailer, 🙊 . This movie was okay."
Man the amount of overused corny catch phrases is hilarious to me😂 also the sound effects too are just meh. Man this “saga” needs to end already
Fast x is really good movie ❤
I genuinely believe the last Fast movie will be called Fast XXX and it will simultaniously be the finale for both franchises
soundtrack https://youtu.be/DcoO7dQKInY
"I love the part where Dom said to Aquaman “it’s not about fast and furio-me, it’s about fast and furious” truly one of the most movies ever!"
What is going on here ?
OMG my favourite movie 🎥 is back 🔙😊
Every part enemy becomes a family. I hope they are going to be a family in the next part as well. Fast X1😊😊😊
"Dom says we need speed , and I say I need my pillow to spend my time"
XD
THEY MADE JOHN CENA DO AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT??!?!?!
I literally just got home from watching fast x and I loved it but I hated the fact that in they show pictures that would of been impossible for them to have in the film. Pictures that show what we see and not what the characters see which makes no sense at all also there’s one more thing I hated that you see after the credits but I’m not going to say because I don’t wanna spoil it for other people
Pros.  Better than the super non realistic graphics of the last movie.   Cons.The insanely super large cast each movie adds.  I had to look up cast members when watching this movie.  There's so many.  But overall.  I loved this film.
"Garbage , after seen this weirdo guy acting like a lady and painting nails and had nothing to do with the story , i had to take my son out .. waste of money!!"
You are currently completing with indian movies 😒 are we kids infort of you 😒? full of fake unbelievable scenes that could never happen in real life
love
rest in peace paul walker
Ceritanya gantung
❤ #Ronniejoenetwork #Teampayaman
I hope it’s the last one
Crazy how he mentioned “ Defeated the laws of God” and in the first movie they use to pray before eating … just crazy how everything is moving nowadays but yea all these movies suck except for the first 4
Fast and furious 11 ! Who else 👀?
"So many crying b1tches in the comments who don’t know how to enjoy a movie 😂 This one just had to be better than Fast 9 and it was. Jason’s character made it hilarious and fun to watch. It’s a fast a furious movie, obviously there’s unrealistic stunts with themes of family thrown in there"
"And Vin Diesel has sold out to the woke mafia.
Elena was a white woman, Dominic is a white man, how come their child is suddenly black? They ruined that movie too.

Momoa impersonates Johnny Depp. A complete tragedy.
I just deleted the movie after 10 minutes of watching."
"A lot of the comments starting with ""I love"" or something similar. I wonder if that's AI generated comments. Also some of the comments don't read correctly. Haven't watched this movie, but Jason Momoa seems out of place to me in this trailer (and by extension the movie). He's also dressed a little too flamboyant for my liking. It just doesn't feel right (him, this movie, the outfit). They should've just kept going with Charlize Theron and wrapped it up. Not sure if I'm gonna watch this movie or not. I got a feeling they rushed it knowing it was the last one and doesn't matter. Brie Larson also doesn't feel right in this movie either."
"I hated Jason in this movie, actually think he killed it for me. Why he was in it made no sense. Except that he over acted, he presented himself as a fairly child, a oversized sexual character who needs meds. I hated him here, trying to do the worst Johnny Dep impression I've ever seen. Call it what it was, a waste of my personal time. I really think Jason ruined the movie."
"It's a very bad movie, a waste of time."
"I was referring to real life. 

Weapons and cars."
"this has gone from  fast and the furious to  "" the fans is furious"" :P"
I watched it in cinema tbh its very very bad
Stop this non sense yaar … too many films ….
"Movie actually wasn't bad. I did not expect that cliffhanger. Jason Momoa laughing while getting his face beat was very Joker to me. And I'm sure everyone enjoyed when he gagged talking about Dom's ""family"" a nod to all the jokes over the years. The ending was the best part for me. Seeing her come back was awesome! Was expecting to see ""Bryan"" at some point but it never happened."
"Last part of Fast and Furious, Paul Walker comes back"
Did I just watched the whole movie?
What movie or drama tv..part 1 and part 2 sad ending
"Guys,remember it started off with a piece of bread and tuna"
"I loved the part when it is revealed that Dom actually possessed ""Reality Stone"".. He said Reality can be whatever I want, then in flashback scenes we saw by using reality stone Dom made Han and Giselle alive again, added shaw in the family and created a brother"
BRAİN OCANNER didn't want it to be like this
Stupid movies for stupid people.
"I just watch the whole thing, this is already the 10th sequel already and they still wanted to add another sequel☠️"
"I loved the part when goku said Kamehameha, and dom answered, ""famifamilyhaa"", gave me the chills"

I genuinely believe the last Fast movie will be called Fast XXX and it will simultaniously be the finale for both franchises
soundtrack https://youtu.be/DcoO7dQKInY
"I love the part where Dom said to Aquaman “it’s not about fast and furio-me, it’s about fast and furious” truly one of the most movies ever!"
What is going on here ?
OMG my favourite movie 🎥 is back 🔙😊
Every part enemy becomes a family. I hope they are going to be a family in the next part as well. Fast X1😊😊😊
"Dom says we need speed , and I say I need my pillow to spend my time"
XD
THEY MADE JOHN CENA DO AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT??!?!?!
I literally just got home from watching fast x and I loved it but I hated the fact that in they show pictures that would of been impossible for them to have in the film. Pictures that show what we see and not what the characters see which makes no sense at all also there’s one more thing I hated that you see after the credits but I’m not going to say because I don’t wanna spoil it for other people
Pros.  Better than the super non realistic graphics of the last movie.   Cons.The insanely super large cast each movie adds.  I had to look up cast members when watching this movie.  There's so many.  But overall.  I loved this film.
"Garbage , after seen this weirdo guy acting like a lady and painting nails and had nothing to do with the story , i had to take my son out .. waste of money!!"
You are currently completing with indian movies 😒 are we kids infort of you 😒? full of fake unbelievable scenes that could never happen in real life
love
rest in peace paul walker

I hope it’s the last one
Crazy how he mentioned “ Defeated the laws of God” and in the first movie they use to pray before eating … just crazy how everything is moving nowadays but yea all these movies suck except for the first 4
Fast and furious 11 ! Who else 👀?
"So many crying b1tches in the comments who don’t know how to enjoy a movie 😂 This one just had to be better than Fast 9 and it was. Jason’s character made it hilarious and fun to watch. It’s a fast a furious movie, obviously there’s unrealistic stunts with themes of family thrown in there"
"And Vin Diesel has sold out to the woke mafia.
Elena was a white woman, Dominic is a white man, how come their child is suddenly black? They ruined that movie too.

Momoa impersonates Johnny Depp. A complete tragedy.
I just deleted the movie after 10 minutes of watching."
"A lot of the comments starting with ""I love"" or something similar. I wonder if that's AI generated comments. Also some of the comments don't read correctly. Haven't watched this movie, but Jason Momoa seems out of place to me in this trailer (and by extension the movie). He's also dressed a little too flamboyant for my liking. It just doesn't feel right (him, this movie, the outfit). They should've just kept going with Charlize Theron and wrapped it up. Not sure if I'm gonna watch this movie or not. I got a feeling they rushed it knowing it was the last one and doesn't matter. Brie Larson also doesn't feel right in this movie either."
"I hated Jason in this movie, actually think he killed it for me. Why he was in it made no sense. Except that he over acted, he presented himself as a fairly child, a oversized sexual character who needs meds. I hated him here, trying to do the worst Johnny Dep impression I've ever seen. Call it what it was, a waste of my personal time. I really think Jason ruined the movie."
"It's a very bad movie, a waste of time."
"I was referring to real life. 

Weapons and cars."
"this has gone from  fast and the furious to  "" the fans is furious"" :P"
I watched it in cinema tbh its very very bad
Stop this non sense yaar … too many films ….
"Movie actually wasn't bad. I did not expect that cliffhanger. Jason Momoa laughing while getting his face beat was very Joker to me. And I'm sure everyone enjoyed when he gagged talking about Dom's ""family"" a nod to all the jokes over the years. The ending was the best part for me. Seeing her come back was awesome! Was expecting to see ""Bryan"" at some point but it never happened."
"Last part of Fast and Furious, Paul Walker comes back"
Did I just watched the whole movie?
What movie or drama tv..part 1 and part 2 sad ending
"Guys,remember it started off with a piece of bread and tuna"
"I loved the part when it is revealed that Dom actually possessed ""Reality Stone"".. He said Reality can be whatever I want, then in flashback scenes we saw by using reality stone Dom made Han and Giselle alive again, added shaw in the family and created a brother"
BRAİN OCANNER didn't want it to be like this
Stupid movies for stupid people.
"I just watch the whole thing, this is already the 10th sequel already and they still wanted to add another sequel☠️"
"I loved the part when goku said Kamehameha, and dom answered, ""famifamilyhaa"", gave me the chills"
"comments: i love the part...
me: i love it alllllllllllll"
Aquaman has to act for LGBTQ shit? Or is that just a joke?
Booooommmm 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We want to see the rock in next movie
live action hot wheels 💀💀
"There Was Literally No Reason For Larson To Be In This Movie, Her & The Reveal In The End Was Absolutely Unnecessary, Great Film Outside Of That, Waaaaayyyy Better Then F9, F9 Was A Joke!"
Best movie of 2023 ❤
Garbage don't waste your money
AS a New Channel its great inspiration for Me 
I watched the movie and it is cool!
🔥
"🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/7_SZi_9eSZE

Yana vokkof kaffer naaier ok
Judus priest!! Is this the last film in the series? Overkill
"What I learn from this movie :
- Mustang's durability really worth the price
- Dom's team is immortal if you haven't seen their dead bodies"
Out of all the people they will add jason mamoa? He made this series into joke stream
"At this point I wouldn't be surprised if the nephew of the guy who had his DVD players stolen in the first movie comes back for revenge against Dom. 

""Dominic Torreto, you stole my uncle's DVD players. I'm going to destroy your family and take away everything you love""."
I love that they based this movie off of the bible
The story between 5 big muscle men and 6 superheroes.
"I came here to search for the song used in the trailer at 1:40 but seeing the ""I love the part..."" trend made me scroll the comment section to a point where I couldn't control my laughter. And just to keep up with my YouTube ""Family"", I love the part where Dante says, ""Can't wait to see you get out of this one"" and Dom says, ""My family will get me out of this one too!"""
I literally loved the appearance of Jason Statham and Gal Gadot ( my fav) but missed Dwayne johnson. Miss you Paul...
I love that part where Batman beat toreto with  in the finish line

"為正在各種煩惱或病苦中、障礙特別多，或自覺會短壽的有緣人（請加油！不用灰心），介紹一部專為此類問題而設的佛經——「藥師經、藥師咒」。此經咒字數雖少但福德佛力極大，若能讀誦、書寫、印經或轉發經文，讓更多人接觸到，即能得到消災、治病、延壽、滅罪、增福、衣食豐足、所求如願等無量福德利益，轉業改命，復得健康長壽的快樂人生。即使你自覺無病無苦，它還是可以增加你無量福報，因為多念誦也能在冥冥中使此經咒為更多此世界的人所接觸到，由此增加了他們的健康壽命財富等，從而使你累積極大的善業福德，人生各方面都能更進一步。你亦可為有需要的親友念誦迴向亦能有效。所以勸大家多多讀誦、轉發，累積無量改命功德。（當然平日行為也要盡量改惡向善）（看見此文「點讚隨喜」也能有一份功德）（南無「僧伽吒經」，若得見此經名即能滅罪。）

藥師經全文六千多字，有興趣可自行搜尋（篇幅所限貼不出來），最好念誦全文。但若覺字數太多，也可選擇單誦藥師經的核心部分或藥師咒、心咒或名號等。藥師經咒，求治病延壽最是靈驗，亦可求財、滿願、亦可往生西方和得人天護佑等。*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。並且可在每天早上對一杯清水念藥師咒108遍然後給患者喝下去，這樣會更有效。(雖說能治病，但還是該去看醫生的，但它能讓你冥冥中總會遇到更好的醫藥治療，且你身體的自癒能力也會更強，亦能得藥師佛力之加持，故亦的確有可能不藥而癒。若念誦的量和質都足夠高，則醫生都治不好的重病亦有可能治癒。)

藥師經的核心部分（經心）只有約一千字，更方便持誦，且已包括藥師經最主要的功德利益，全文如下：

「復次、曼殊室利！若有四眾：苾芻、苾芻尼、鄔波索迦、鄔波斯迦，及餘淨信善男子、善女人等，有能受持八分齋戒，或經一年、或復三月受持學處，以此善根，願生西方極樂世界無量壽佛所聽聞正法而未定者，若聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，臨命終時，有八大菩薩，其名曰：文殊師利菩薩，觀世音菩薩，得大勢菩薩，無盡意菩薩，寶檀華菩薩，藥王菩薩，藥上菩薩，彌勒菩薩。是八大菩薩乘空而來，示其道路，即於彼界種種雜色眾寶華中，自然化生」。
 
「或有因此，生於天上，雖生天上，而本善根，亦未窮盡，不復更生諸餘惡趣。天上壽盡，還生人間，或為輪王，統攝四洲，威德自在，安立無量百千有情於十善道；或生剎帝利、婆羅門、居士大家，多饒財寶，倉庫盈溢，形相端嚴，眷屬具足，聰明智慧，勇健威猛，如大力士。若是女人，得聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，至心受持，於後不復更受女身」。
 
「復次、曼殊室利！彼藥師琉璃光如來得菩提時，由本願力，觀諸有情，遇眾病苦瘦攣、乾消、黃熱等病；或被厭魅、蠱毒所中；或復短命，或時橫死；欲令是等病苦消除，所求願滿」。
 
「時彼世尊，入三摩地，名曰除滅一切眾生苦惱。既入定已，於肉髻中出大光明，光中演說，大陀羅尼曰：『那謨薄伽筏帝，裨殺社，窶嚕，薜琉璃，缽剌婆，喝囉闍也，怛陀揭多耶，阿羅訶帝，三藐三勃陀耶。怛姪阤：唵，鞞殺逝，鞞殺逝，鞞殺社，三沒揭帝娑訶』」。爾時、光中說此咒已，大地震動，放大光明，一切眾生病苦皆除，受安隱樂。
 
「曼殊室利！若見男子、女人有病苦者，應當一心，為彼病人，常清淨澡漱，或食、或藥、或無蟲水、咒一百八遍，與彼服食，所有病苦悉皆消滅。若有所求，志心念誦，皆得如是，無病延年；命終之後，生彼世界，得不退轉，乃至菩提。是故曼殊室利！若有男子、女人，於彼藥師琉璃光如來，至心殷重，恭敬供養者，常持此咒，勿令廢忘」。
 
「復次、曼殊室利！若有淨信男子女人，得聞藥師琉璃光如來應正等覺所有名號，聞已誦持。晨嚼齒木，澡漱清淨，以諸香花，燒香、塗香，作眾伎樂，供養形象。於此經典，若自書，若教人書，一心受持，聽聞其義。於彼法師，應修供養：一切所有資身之具，悉皆施與，勿令乏少。如是便蒙諸佛護念，所求願滿，乃至菩提」。
 
爾時、曼殊室利童子白佛言：「世尊！我當誓於像法轉時，以種種方便，令諸淨信善男子、善女人等，得聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，乃至睡中亦以佛名覺悟其耳。世尊！若於此經受持讀誦。或復為他演說開示；若自書、若教人書；恭敬尊重，以種種華香、塗香、末香、燒香、花鬘、瓔珞、幡（番）蓋、伎樂，而為供養；以五色綵，作囊盛之；掃灑淨處，敷設高座，而用安處。爾時、四大天王與其眷屬，及餘無量百千天眾，皆詣其所，供養守護。世尊！若此經寶流行之處，有能受持，以彼世尊藥師琉璃光如來本願功德，及聞名號，當知是處無復橫死；亦復不為諸惡鬼神奪其精氣，設已奪者，還得如故，身心安樂。」

梵音藥師咒之國語註音：（可參考相關YouTube影片學習發音）*若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。
「那摩 巴噶瓦爹 白薩加 咕嚕 外度裡呀 缽啊巴 喇加呀 達踏嘎達呀 啊喇爹 三藐三布達呀， 達滴呀踏，嗡，白沙接 白沙接 白沙駕 三目嘎爹 刷哈」

藥師佛心咒國語註音：
「嗲雅他唵 貝看傑 貝看傑 瑪哈貝看傑 喇札沙母恩嘎得 梭哈」

藥師解冤咒：（此咒可除了具治病延壽之效，還能解冤消業，可以消去與冤家的恩怨，使人際關係變好，夫妻和睦等）
「解結解結解冤結  解了多生冤和業
洗心滌慮發虔誠  今對佛前求解結
藥師佛  藥師佛  消災延壽藥師佛  隨心滿願藥師佛」

若仍覺經咒太長或難學，亦可單誦藥師佛之聖號：南無藥師琉璃光如來或南無藥師佛。當然重申一遍，經咒威力功德當然是據字數之多少而等而下之的，所以最好是誦經典全文，只是為了方便，所以才有更便於持誦的經心或咒語部分，但當然你念字數更少的法若想要有跟讀經一遍相同之功德，就該念誦更多遍了。
*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。

其他咒語：

（專治癌症、瘤、痔瘡、炎症等）佛說療痔病陀羅尼.(請參看相關經文)
國語註音:
「達底呀踏，啊藍爹 ，啊藍美，薛瑞比，薛瑞，薛瑞，嘛嘎西基，三拔哇度，刷哈

（專消業治病）觀音治病咒：Ong 避路拉基 堅都喜哈 避沙嘛 些哈木 堅都奇悲些拉達 避拉呀 刷哈

*若仍嫌麻煩，可單誦「南無觀世音菩薩」為入門，救急救苦，每求必驗，遇上任何大大小小的苦惱困難皆可念誦，多持誦也能得消罪增福、延壽生西、福德無量。"

若仍覺經咒太長或難學，亦可單誦藥師佛之聖號：南無藥師琉璃光如來或南無藥師佛。當然重申一遍，經咒威力功德當然是據字數之多少而等而下之的，所以最好是誦經典全文，只是為了方便，所以才有更便於持誦的經心或咒語部分，但當然你念字數更少的法若想要有跟讀經一遍相同之功德，就該念誦更多遍了。
*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。

Aqua man be touchy touchy with his kids tho!
"When morbius said “it’s morbin time” but then Dom said “no, it’s family time” I morbed all over the scene! Oscar a truly nomination"
I actually walked out the movie theater for the first time eva 😂😭
This is not how you do a trailer. They ended up spoiling the movie.
আলহামদুলিল্লাহ  নিজেই ক্যামেরার সামনে এসে ভিডিও  দিয়েছি আমার জন্য দোয়া করবেন সবাইকে ধন্যবাদ ❤
damn the real movie left my hanging I might need some time to move on from it
Wowww
Haduh gantung
Great thanks  ❤  ❤
"This trailer is sending me is saying is that, people aren’t gonna see it so they spoil you with longer trailer, 🙊 . This movie was okay."
Man the amount of overused corny catch phrases is hilarious to me😂 also the sound effects too are just meh. Man this “saga” needs to end already
Fast x is really good movie ❤
I genuinely believe the last Fast movie will be called Fast XXX and it will simultaniously be the finale for both franchises
soundtrack https://youtu.be/DcoO7dQKInY
"I love the part where Dom said to Aquaman “it’s not about fast and furio-me, it’s about fast and furious” truly one of the most movies ever!"
What is going on here ?
OMG my favourite movie 🎥 is back 🔙😊
Every part enemy becomes a family. I hope they are going to be a family in the next part as well. Fast X1😊😊😊
"Dom says we need speed , and I say I need my pillow to spend my time"
XD
THEY MADE JOHN CENA DO AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT??!?!?!
I literally just got home from watching fast x and I loved it but I hated the fact that in they show pictures that would of been impossible for them to have in the film. Pictures that show what we see and not what the characters see which makes no sense at all also there’s one more thing I hated that you see after the credits but I’m not going to say because I don’t wanna spoil it for other people
Pros.  Better than the super non realistic graphics of the last movie.   Cons.The insanely super large cast each movie adds.  I had to look up cast members when watching this movie.  There's so many.  But overall.  I loved this film.
"Garbage , after seen this weirdo guy acting like a lady and painting nails and had nothing to do with the story , i had to take my son out .. waste of money!!"
You are currently completing with indian movies 😒 are we kids infort of you 😒? full of fake unbelievable scenes that could never happen in real life
love
rest in peace paul walker

I hope it’s the last one
Crazy how he mentioned “ Defeated the laws of God” and in the first movie they use to pray before eating … just crazy how everything is moving nowadays but yea all these movies suck except for the first 4
Fast and furious 11 ! Who else 👀?
"So many crying b1tches in the comments who don’t know how to enjoy a movie 😂 This one just had to be better than Fast 9 and it was. Jason’s character made it hilarious and fun to watch. It’s a fast a furious movie, obviously there’s unrealistic stunts with themes of family thrown in there"
"And Vin Diesel has sold out to the woke mafia.
Elena was a white woman, Dominic is a white man, how come their child is suddenly black? They ruined that movie too.

Momoa impersonates Johnny Depp. A complete tragedy.
I just deleted the movie after 10 minutes of watching."
"A lot of the comments starting with ""I love"" or something similar. I wonder if that's AI generated comments. Also some of the comments don't read correctly. Haven't watched this movie, but Jason Momoa seems out of place to me in this trailer (and by extension the movie). He's also dressed a little too flamboyant for my liking. It just doesn't feel right (him, this movie, the outfit). They should've just kept going with Charlize Theron and wrapped it up. Not sure if I'm gonna watch this movie or not. I got a feeling they rushed it knowing it was the last one and doesn't matter. Brie Larson also doesn't feel right in this movie either."
"I hated Jason in this movie, actually think he killed it for me. Why he was in it made no sense. Except that he over acted, he presented himself as a fairly child, a oversized sexual character who needs meds. I hated him here, trying to do the worst Johnny Dep impression I've ever seen. Call it what it was, a waste of my personal time. I really think Jason ruined the movie."
"It's a very bad movie, a waste of time."
"I was referring to real life. 

Weapons and cars."
"this has gone from  fast and the furious to  "" the fans is furious"" :P"
I watched it in cinema tbh its very very bad
Stop this non sense yaar … too many films ….
"Movie actually wasn't bad. I did not expect that cliffhanger. Jason Momoa laughing while getting his face beat was very Joker to me. And I'm sure everyone enjoyed when he gagged talking about Dom's ""family"" a nod to all the jokes over the years. The ending was the best part for me. Seeing her come back was awesome! Was expecting to see ""Bryan"" at some point but it never happened."
"Last part of Fast and Furious, Paul Walker comes back"
Did I just watched the whole movie?
What movie or drama tv..part 1 and part 2 sad ending
"Spelline bee judge: Your word is Sesquipedalian
Dom:  F - A - M - I - L -Y"
"Darth Vader: Dom, I am your father
Dom: i knew you were, FAMILY"
Funny how Doms kid is brown on this movie
I am 8 and I love the fast  series and I am so excited for fast x
But I am waiting for the part 2 of fast X
"We've watch this it was so intense and trill, also those fav Hollywood actors are here"
Saw this yesterday.  ❤I can't wait to get it on DVD.
"The movie is garbage, literally a waste of time and money, acting is shit, alot of I mean alloottt of video editing and fake scenes, alot of confusion and it's overall just the worst franchise ever made, DONT WATCH IT ITS SHIT, FYI the flight attendant in the movie is Paul walker real daughter"
"Dom Ganja 🙈 Comment ready 
only Pakistani"
we love fast and furious movies
"I love the part where, there is not part left to run"
"It's not action anymore, goes more comedy film, just like Bollywood 😂😂"
Woooaahh aquaman vs all😁
Why dom son come black
"Can change the tittle of the name to : Luck & Furious. 
The level of luckiness in the 🍿 😂"
They have 2 actors from game of thrones and believed their movie was as good
Do I understand this correctly that this movie is about the cars? Or is it some marvel/dc crossover ?
"Lol...Everyones talking about there best part but mine was When Hitler said ""We have to shoot our best Asset to win this war"" & Dom ""Shoots his Family"" Such A LEGEND!"
